<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
<p>
We hope to shed light on gender bias within the modern workplace, exposing its roots to deconstruct the glass ceiling that currently separates women from men. In this way, we can positively promote gender equality, coming together as a community to raise awareness of our own unconscious biases. 
</p>


<h2 id=gap>DEFINING THE GENDER GAP</h2>
<p>
Despite modern day women catching up to their male counterparts in education, they still experience a noticeable gap in the professional world. Women do not receive equal pay, equal opportunities and promotions, or even equal recognition when compared to men. On a global scale, the US ranks 23rd in terms of gender gap where, nationwide, women make an average of 77¢ for every dollar their male colleagues earn. In some states, a woman can make as little as 64 ¢ per dollar.
<br>
<br>
But why are women less recognized in the workplace? Recent studies have shown that women typically tend to underestimate their abilities and performance, while men will often overestimate both even when the quality of their performance does not differ. Despite positive changes in the workforce for women, they still tend to have less conﬁdence in their ability than men—a trait that holds them back from expressing opinions, proposing solutions, and negotiating salaries. By contrast, men will take bigger risks, reaching for their goals even when they aren’t completely prepared. Women, who are more likely to be burdened with perfectionism, will only attempt to complete a goal when they are more than qualiﬁed and prepared.
